Train Schedule 

This project produces a train schedule based on the time of the first train of the day and the number of minutes between trains.  
Users can input the train name, destination, time of the first train of the day, and time between trains.
The time the schedule is accessed is captured and displayed as the current time.   
Time of the next train and the number of minutes until the next train arrives is relative to this current time.
